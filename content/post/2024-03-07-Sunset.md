I'll be shutting this blog down eventually but for the time being just not posting here. All new blog posts will be published over at [AltitudeCode](https://altitudecode.com.au) e.g. [this one from Adam on React optimisations](https://altitudecode.com.au/posts/2024-02-29-optimizing-computation-in-react/) or [this one I wrote on migrating Route 53 Hosted Zones](https://altitudecode.com.au/posts/2024-02-27-migrate-route-53-aws-account/).

The blog lasted about three and a half years which is a fair shout. Not a lot of content over that time but was good to jot down thoughts as I went.

Ciao...
