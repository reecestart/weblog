I love good Australian Films. Some of my favourites are [Two Hands](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145547/) and [The Bank](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0241223/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_8). Went and saw this film last night called [The Dry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5144174/). It's a mystery slash crime who done it type flick set in rural Australia (Victoria outside Melbourne according to IMDB - little town called [Horsham](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Horsham+VIC+3400/@-36.7172561,142.1611876,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6ace4535fb847865:0x50579a430a0d530!8m2!3d-36.7188618!4d142.1962316)). Really sad and dark film but also beautiful in terms of the setting. Very authentic for the most part apart from the local cop character who I thought was a bit of a caricature rather than a real person. Screenplay, based off the novel by [Jane Harper](https://janeharper.com.au/Books/The-Dry), written and directed by [Robert Connolly](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175352/?ref_=tt_ov_dr) who I don't know too much about but will definitely be keeping an eye on. I thought [Eric Bana](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051509/?ref_=tt_cl_t1) was brilliant but the star of the show was [Genevieve O'Reilly](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0642444/?ref_=tt_cl_t2) she was captivating in every scene. Shout out also to [BeBe Bettencourt](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10710511/?ref_=tt_cl_t8) who plays a young *Ellie* - I think she'll be doing some big things in the future. My final shout out goes to [Peter Raeburn](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1041285/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr13) who composed the music for the film - really added to the atmosphere.
