Having just turned *Thirty-Three* and having this song come up in my Liked Songs I thought what better song to start off posting about.

Great album, [Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness](https://open.spotify.com/album/55RhFRyQFihIyGf61MgcfV?si=Z2UEodr4S0mHekB23zcp9w), and this one of the lesser tracks in terms of popularity but underrated in my thoughts. Used to listen to this a lot as a youngster with lyrics like the below resonating as you would expect with a teenager.

    As the cluttered streets greet me once again
    I know I can't be late
    Supper's waiting on the table

So many other great tracks on this album. *[Tonight, Tonight](https://open.spotify.com/track/7bu0znpSbTks0O6I98ij0W?si=wYUh72l7SHaT_qw9vxu5Jw)* would have to be up there with the best. The guitar picking reminds me a little bit of The Cranberries [*Linger*](https://open.spotify.com/track/0gEyKnHvgkrkBM6fbeHdwK?si=b-8gfa_fTaOB6IptIRVatQ) but that orchestral opening is grandiose. And I've always loved the video clip.

Highlight would have to be seeing Billy perform it live at Laneway Festival in Brissy. Could only imagine what seeing them live in '96 when they performed [this setlist](https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-smashing-pumpkins/1996/brisbane-festival-hall-brisbane-australia-4bc37f9a.html) was like.

Finally to close this post out with a track they haven't put up on Spotify. An acoustic version of *[Mayonaise](https://open.spotify.com/track/2junx9LRubsMY2OHaSc5DE?si=kLzYcWSXQv-VgHPGCP-K-g)* I used to listen to on my Winamp player.
