So I stumbled upon [this blog post for CI/CD of Hugo blog with CircleCI](https://mostlygeek.com/posts/hugo-circle-s3-hosting/) and thought why not, give it a go. The impetus of this was I had a new dev machine, and my source repo of my weblog .gitignore excluded my previous [Makefile](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile). Having to install [s3deploy](https://github.com/bep/s3deploy) again locally and manage didn't feel right: this should really be off-loaded to an automated, managed - and if possible - free service. Introducing [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

# CircleCI

Once I got CircleCI integrated and building on each push I noticed the instructions from the previous blog were a little outdated.
