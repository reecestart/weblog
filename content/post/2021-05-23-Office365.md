After a number of attempts trying to embrace [ProtonMail](https://denne.com.au/2021/02/03/protonmail/) and [ProtonCalendar](https://protonmail.com/blog/protoncalendar-beta-announcement/) into my workflow I've decided to go roundabout back to Office 365 after having initially migrated from there to [Zoho](https://denne.com.au/2020/12/23/zoho/) and then from there to ProtonMail.

The problems mainly arose from being unable to accept invitations while I was mobile, unable to use 3rd party clients when mobile, and just a bit of a clunky experience. Also their promotional info was a little bit misleading saying you could have 5 email '[aliases](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/addresses-and-aliases/)' with a Proton Plus account - these are essentially just redirects not other full mailboxes which is what I was looking for with my custom domain.

So with that, back to what I know works with my workflow and is pretty good value for what you pay - 0365.

# Setting up the account

Now it seems I alredy have that old account with O365 so after resetting that password I am in. This seems easier than I thought.

Then a stumling block. denne.com.au isn't in their system.

Okay the username or email I entered does not exist.

Might have to find another way to sign up here.

Okay I am in now and it has given me the option for Microsoft 365 Personal, for one person at AU$99.00/year billed annually. Seems about right.

After entering my credit card details and some nice JavaScript annimations I am then prompted to Upgrade to Microsoft 365 Family for only AU$30.00 more per year. I don't need to do this now but may do in the future so this is good to know. I'm then prompted with a large banner saying **Success! Youâ€™ve just renewed Microsoft 365** which reminds me of...

It's about this time I realise I've purchased the wrong subscription. I purchased the Microsoft 365 Personal which doesn't let you use custom domains - you need to use the Microsoft 365 Business Basic. After chatting to support they will process a refund to me which is nice. At this point the Microsoft agent mentions that you can use the Microsoft 365 Personal/Family if the domain is from [Go Daddy](https://denne.com.au/2020/10/27/domain/). After reviewing [the offer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-a-personalized-email-address-in-microsoft-365-75416a58-b225-4c02-8c07-8979403b427b#bkmk_notmanagedbygodaddy) it appears it will work only if I use Go Daddy's nameservers but I am using Route 53 for a number of other things so need to go to business. So after the agent processes the refund it is off to Microsoft 356 Business Basic.

At this point you need to create an .onmicrosoft.com ID which is a bit annoying as it's just one more thing to remember, or for LastPass to remember. After handing over my billing details again I click Start Trial. Yes, they have a one month trial so why not. Then I am up and going.

First action is Set up email with a custom domain...

![Set up email](/public/img/Set-up-email.webp)

After adding the TXT and MX records to the existing record sets (as new lines) in Route 53 I am prompted to create a new account with my custom domain and sign out. At this point I am signing in to my new email address, but it is a "IT or Work" account not a "Personal" one, and the password is that of the weird .onmicrosoft.com ID I created, just to make things interesting.

At this point it would appear the emails sent from my custom email and domain are being sent from and received with Office 365 so I can leave the other MX records for ProtonMail there as backup given they are lower priority. Now to export everything from mail and calendar in ProtonMail... and ProtonCalendar.

Luckily for paid users there is an Import-Export app. It gives you an export format of MBOX or EML. Although it doesn't appear Office 365 will take either of those formats. Looks like the easiest way to migrate across will be using a local client like Outlook and ProtonBridge and drag and drop. Pretty rudimentary but that looks like how it is going to end up. While 1,676 emails are downloaded and unencrypted I wait.

After the drag, drop and uplod party was over I went to the Calendar to see what I could export. They have an export ICS function so I gave that a try. This all seemed to go quite well. ProtonCalendar exported as an ICS and Microsoft 365 allowed me to import it directly into my default calendar.

At this point I deleted my ProtonMail account and uninstalled Proton Bridge and Proton Import-Export as well as uninstalled the ProtonVPN and ProtonCalendar and ProtonMail apps from my phone.
