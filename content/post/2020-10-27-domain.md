So I registered a new Domain [https://denne.com.au](https://denne.com.au) with [GoDaddy](https://au.godaddy.com/). I did this as my old @live.com address I've had for 15 or so years started running into issues where I stopped receiving some emails. And as it was a free service getting support was pretty hard. It forced my hand to register the domain and subscribe to [O365](https://www.office.com/?auth=2).

A little update: I've transferred my [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/) from GoDaddy to a [Route 53 Hosted Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html). DNS propagation was quite quick and pointed directly to the S3 Bucket for static website hosting. Now to set up a CloudFront distribution in front.

A little further in and I've set up the CloudFront distribution but need to attach a trusted certificate that verifies I can use that domain. Over to ACM to create the certificate request then back to Route 53 to verify via DNS. There's a handy button that will do this in the console but I missed that and did it manually. Pending validation. Validated, added to distribution with alternate domain name update and wait. Then restrict the S3 Bucket to the CloudFront Distribution with [Origin Access Identity](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-access-to-amazon-s3/).

An update: had issues with the CloudFront distribution because the Origin Domain Name and Path I was using wasn't setup correctly. I was using the S3 Bucket Name and then the service endpoint:

    denne.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com

What I needed to be doing as documented in [this support article](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-website-cloudfront-error-403/) was use the website endpoint format like so:
