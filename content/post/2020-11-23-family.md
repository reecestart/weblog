- Language: [Gundjeihmi](https://bininjkunwok.org.au/information/orthography/) [Mayali](https://kunwok.org/wiki/Main_Page) - [Dictionary](https://www.njamed.com/) noting that some words like Crocodile are listed as *kinga* when it should be *ginga* much like how Gundjeihmi is now listed as Kundjeyhmi i.e. the 'K' is replacing the 'G'
- Clan: Djok - as opposed to [this SMH article](https://www.smh.com.au/national/sole-survivor-sitting-on-a-5b-fortune-20070714-gdqm7s.html) which says there is only one sole member of the Djok clan which is not true.
- Land: [Koongarra](https://www.google.com/maps/place/12%C2%B050'54.4%22S+132%C2%B051'35.9%22E/@-12.8484368,132.8577723,1143m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m9!1m2!2m1!1sKoongarra!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d-12.8484424!4d132.8599611) - where my families dreaming are painted
