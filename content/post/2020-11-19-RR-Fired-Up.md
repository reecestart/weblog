RR - also known  as [Release Radar](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYr4LowI3tAhXvxjgGHXotAXcQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fplaylist%2F37i9dQZEVXbfU16Bu3hLvu&usg=AOvVaw1FZBKR4IVheh8HbHPqhJui) from Spotify is an auto-generated playlist. This is their description:

    Catch all the latest music from artists you follow, plus new singles picked for you.
    Updates every Friday. 30 songs.

I go through these tracks and add the ones I like to my Liked Songs and I thought it would be good source of content to post about so here are the six tracks that I rate. Six from Thirty, one in five, not bad.

# *A Million Times - HONNE remix* - Cosmo's Midnight, HONNE

I rate both these artists, have seen HONNE live at [Splendour](https://musicfeeds.com.au/news/splendour-in-the-grass-announces-2019-lineup/) a few years ago and they've got a great live set. Haven't even listened to the original of this one but this remix was smooth enough to get that like early. The Chorus is light and airy and catchy as hell.

# *SAME PLACE* - Tia Gostelow

Tia is a bit of a fave of mine like a few of her songs starting with *Vague Utopia*, then *Phone Me*, then she followed up with that Holy Holy collab on *ALWAYS* - all great tracks. *SAME PLACE* is a little different, more airy (is that a theme of the songs this week?) with driving keys and with the baseline has an 80's kind of vibe.

# *Really Love (feat. Craig David & Digital Farm Animals) - Blinkie Remix* - KSI, Craig David, Digital Farm Animals, Blinkie

Don't know a lot about KSI, Digital Farm Animals or Blinkie but can say seeing [Craig David at Glasto](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi-pcHuxI3tAhUTzTgGHUkJBAIQFjAAegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fevents%2Fec584f%2Facts%2Fawvqwh&usg=AOvVaw2oG7Xx1vD6aSve3uqsNmPD) rock the Pyramid Stage in '17 was awesome. This track really hits and the back and forth between KSI and David has a great contrast that lifts it all to another level.

# *Passenger - Mike Shinoda Remix* - Deftones, Mike Shinoda

Hadn't heard this song in a long time but from what I can gather there's a new album coming out from Deftones of their all time great album *White Pony* remixed by other artists in the [Stars - *Do You Trust Your Friends*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6YjZy9c9RBiouy4SK2kYqY?si=6rdoxhHXRl-jn8nq5nsMRQ) motif. They're calling it *Black Stallion*. Can't wait to hear it to be honest. *Knife Prty*, *Teenager*, *Change (In the House of Flies)*. Should be unreal. What Shinoda has done with Passenger is make it feel like a journey, really bringing out the vocals of Chino and MJK and creating some amazing buildups. Think I like it more than the original hats off.

# *Waiting for This Love* - Pete Murray

Some new Pete Murray from his album *The Night*. A bit of a softly spoken one, the intro makes me think a little bit of *Kings of Convenience* until you hit Pete's iconic deep vocals. The female duet works well for the Chorus and the string accompaniment adds a nice layer that makes this track beautiful.

# *Fired Up* - DZ Deathrays

Absolute banger. Unreal video reminds me a lot of [*At The Door* from The Strokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CAz_vvsK9M) but way more absurd - directed by Thomas Rawle. Really feel the addition of Lachlan has helped fill out the band heaps. When I saw them [live with Polish Club at the Tiv](https://thetivoli.com.au/events/tivoli/dz-deathrays-2019) just before COVID took over everything I thought their live act was super solid compared to early days. Really grown and matured and should really have been on the bill for the AFL GF if you ask me.
