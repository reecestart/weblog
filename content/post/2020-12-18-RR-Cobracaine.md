Another one of my Release Radar posts.

# *Not Ready For Love - Stripped Back* - Tyne-James Organ

Very similar to his [*Watch You Go*](https://open.spotify.com/track/1751ZPhM7F7BaMweM3ClEH?si=oxgk622UTsu7Ys7Itbt4rQ) track which I rate highly. This one has a good build up, and it's quite an emotional subject from the Wollongong born, Melbourne based artist. Give it a listen.

# *All About You (feat. Foster The People) - Tensnake Remix* - The Knocks, Tensnake, Foster The People

What a line-up. What can I say, this groovy synth really sets the tone for this remix. Very uplifting, colourful, delicious vibes is how I describe it. The keys breakdown in the middle helps lay the platform for the choir bridge then it gets right back into the groove after an awesome drop.

Trippy video made pretty much of stock footage. Really digging this collaboration. Grew on me a lot. Really love this one, driving, pulsating, relentless climax that is so far from how it starts with the single guitar smothered in reverb and delay. 

# *Cobracaine - Jacques Lu Cont Remix [Edit]* - DMA'S, Jacques Lu Cont

This is a true garage house tune, absolute fire. Bit a a night-run vibe too, that overrun style. Like blade runner meets [born slippy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf4uiRr78dU). Great track to round out this week's RR.
