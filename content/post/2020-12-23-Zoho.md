So I've been using Office 365 for hosting my email for the past few months after I ran into an issue with my free live.com account not receiving email after many years. You can read a little more about that in [this previous post](https://denne.com.au/2020/10/27/domain/) if it's of interest. And it's been working well, no problems for the most part. I'm on the [Microsoft 365 Business Basic plan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-business-basic) if that helps frame where I am coming from. Every month I receive a PDF invoice for $0, not sure why, didn't look into it just kind of didn't look a gift horse in the mouth. This month however I've noticed $7.59 AUD. At 12 months that's $91.08 just for hosting email. So I had a quick look around for alternatives and a familiar one popped up...

## Zoho

I've used [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/) before for hosting other domains, again mainly for email with custom domain, and it worked well for the most part apart from some weird issues with the console. It also lets you set up distribution lists which it calls groups which is great for organising different accounts used online. And the best part is it is free. So, can't go wrong with that. Let's walk through the steps to migrate from 0365 to Zoho.

### Step 1: Account and Domain Setup

Pretty self-explanatory. Sign up for a Zoho account - the indefinite free one. Once there you are prompted to create a TXT record to validate you own the domain.

I'm using [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) so logging in there and creating the record in the hosted zone.

![Route 53 TXT](/public/img/route-53-txt.webp)

Then go back to Zoho and click the big Verify by TXT button.

![Verify by TXT](/public/img/verify-by-txt.webp)

This took a little while for me. Quite a while. Too long in fact so I just used the CNAME method and that resolved almost instantly.

### Step 2: Zoho Users, Groups and Email Delivery

Next create your Super Admin account to administer Zoho. As I'm an Individual Professional and the only user in the Organization I'm going to skip the Adding Users part. Groups also, which I mentioned earlier can be used as a distribution list for organising accounts for online identities - I'm going to skip that too. Next is configuring Email Delivery. Do this by creating MX records for your domain. I update the exiting MX record for outook.com to point to the three Zoho mail servers.

![MX Record Change](/public/img/mx-record-change.webp)

This also takes a while. Eventually it verified and now on to SPF/DKIM. From the Domain Setup page:

    SPF or Sender Policy Framework is a text record associated with the domain to identify the servers permitted to send emails using the particular domain name.

And...

    In addition to SPF records, you can add DKIM signature for your domain, to ensure better email deliverability. Using a DKIM signature also ensures that valid emails sent from your domain, using Zoho, are not classified as Spam at the receivers end. DKIM is an authentication method, which uses encryption to validate if the email is generated from the authorized systems, as approved by the domains administrators. The public key published as TXT record in your DNS is used to validate the DKIM signature by the receiving server.

So let's set up both. Pretty much the same steps as before, two TXT records one blank for the SPF and another with a value for DKIM that is generated via the setup screen.

### Step 3: Email Migration

Zoho comes with a handy little email migration wizard. Give the migration a name. It also comes pre-loaded with settings for O365 which is nice. I selected Mail, Contacts and Calendar to migrate. Enter in the O365 Admin email address and password. Then click Add Migration.

![O365 Zoho Migration](/public/img/o365-zoho-migration.webp)

This prompted an error however as I needed to setup [O365 Application Impersonation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-configure-impersonation) for Zoho first.

Login to the [Exchange Admin Center](https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/?rfr=Admin_o365) and go to Permissions, Admin Roles. Then click the plus ('+') icon to create a new role.

![Exchange Admin Role](/public/img/exchange-admin-role.webp)

Give it a name, add the ApplicationImpersonation Role, then assign Users as Members to that Role - in my case it was just my O365 account and I also added the Company Administrator in case that may also have needed access.

![Application Impersonation Role](/public/img/application-impersonation-role.webp)

It may take a while for the changes to propagate and to be able to add the migration. After a while it allowed me to create the migration. Then I added my account same source and destination. Then clicked start migration.

![Start Mail Migration](/public/img/start-mail-migration.webp)

The migration first moved over my contacts. Saw them all appear in my [Zoho Mail app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoho.mail&hl=en_AU&gl=US). Mail and Calendar took a while to start though. In the meantime I went back to the [Zoho Mail Control Panel Dashboard](https://mailadmin.zoho.com.au/cpanel/index.do#dashboard/general). It seemed I had an issue with the SPF configuration.

![Configure SPF Records](/public/img/configure-spf-records.webp)

All I needed to do was Verify the SPF Status for my domain as I'd already created the record. With the green tick in  the books moved on to other housekeeping.

### Step 4: Housekeeping, MFA

While the migration was chugging away (812 Mail, 397 Calendar entries so far) I looked into some other settings in the Zoho console. The first is setting up 2FA/MFA for in my [User Details](https://mailadmin.zoho.com.au/cpanel/index.do#userdetails).

To first do this it appears you need to [enable 2FA/MFA at the Org level](https://www.zoho.com/mail/help/adminconsole/two-factor-authentication.html). You do this by jumping over to the [Zoho Accounts MFA Modes](https://accounts.zoho.com.au/home#multiTFA/modes) section - and there are quite a few. [Zoho OneAuth](https://www.zoho.com/accounts/oneauth.html) which appears to be Zoho's own MFA service kind of like [Duo](https://duo.com/), it also has Mobile-based OTP where you get your OTP SMS to your mobile, Time-based OTP which you setup using an authenticator app and QR code, and YubiKey. I'm using [Authy](https://authy.com/) so I'll be using the Time-based OTP.

![Zoho MFA Options](/public/img/zoho-mfa-options.webp)

Next I changed my timezone from Sydney to Brisbane so that I don't run into any issues when DST kicks in and my calendar appointments go haywire. Then set a security question. Changed my date format preferences. I also went into Mail Administration and set SPF Verification Fail and Soft Fail to move those emails into my Quarantine, mostly to limit SPAM but also to just test out the feature. I did the same for DKIM Verification. To make this actually useful I also setup Quarantine notifications so it emails me once an email is sent to Quarantine for approval.

At this point my Mail migration completed with only four emails unable to be migrated as they were too large for my organization size limit of 25MB.

At this point all that was left was to migrate across my OneDrive files to whatever Zoho's equivalent is which appears to be [Zoho WorkDrive](https://www.zoho.com/workdrive/). Unfortunately this doesn't appear to come for free so I will have to find an alternative. I decided to go with [Box](https://account.box.com/signup/n/personal) which gives you 10GB for free.

Now I've only got 70-something MB in my OneDrive and I could just download and upload but where's the fun in that. Plus there's a [OneDrive Python SDK](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-sdk-python) and a [Box Python SDK](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk) both on GitHub so let's see if I can write something to transfer over...

![One Hour Later](/public/img/one-hour-later.webp)

Okay, so it appears that the Discovery Service API which the OneDrive for Business Python SDK uses has been deprecated in favour of the new [Microsoft Graph REST APIs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/blogs/upcoming-deprecation-of-discovery-service-api/). Unfortunately as a number of [open](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-sdk-python/issues/119) [issues](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-sdk-python/issues/164) show it's better to just use requests and tbh that doesn't excite me as much so it's a manual download and upload :confused:

That took a good 3 min at most. Ah well.

### Step 5: Close Down O365

Delete all items from OneDrive, delete all items from Outlook, after that in order to cancel the subscription I first need to remove the domain and in order to do that I need to change the User Principal Name or UPN for my account.

![Remove Domain Dependencies](/public/img/remove-domain-dependencies.webp)

Once I'm over to the .onmicrosoft.com domain I log out, then log in, then I can remove the domain. It can take up to 24 hours to remove a domain it seems. Luckily I don't have to wait for that as I can just go to [my products](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?#/subscriptions) and cancel the subscription. Interestingly this just disables the subscription. There is a separate area to [delete the subscription](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home?#/subscriptions/webdirect/).

I then found [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/close-your-account?view=o365-worldwide) which steps through the additional things you need to do before the account will be deleted like removing MFA, deleting the Azure AD, etc. It seems though that you still need to wait a few days, probably as a fail-safe mechanism, for the subscription to be deleted before you can delete the Azure AD tenant.

![Subscription Deleted Soon](/public/img/subscription-deleted-soon.webp)

So that's it, migration done and in three or four days I'll login to the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) and finish deleting the tenant.

#### Update

And after a few days I was able to delete the Azure AD tenant.
