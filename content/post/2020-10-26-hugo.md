So I've created a new blog and a new blog needs a new static site generator. This time I've gone for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) over [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which I used to use. The former being written in [Go](https://golang.org/) as opposed to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) for the later.

Will update this page with more thoughts as I use it.

An update: playing around with Hugo after deploying it to S3 using:
    hugo deploy
I found that I'm getting 'No changes required'. I also ran:
    hugo -d site
So not sure why that's not being picked up as any changes.

#### Tips

Here are some tips I've found on the way for Hugo:
