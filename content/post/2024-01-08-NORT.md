[![NORT](/public/img/NORT.svg "NORT")](https://altitudecode.com.au/services/nort/)

Started building a service after a having a chat with [a good mate of mine](https://aquainnis.com/#about). Using Twilio and AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB and OpenAI's API for Assistant. Opens up the opportunity for giving those who may not have access to data/Internet the ability to leverage GPT services (e.g. ChatGPT).
