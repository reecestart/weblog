Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Reece, and this is my weblog about various technical subjects, music, sport, culture and the occasional personal topic.

## Personal Information

I live with my wife, Prue, and our sons in Brisbane, Australia. When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I'm enjoying what south-east Queensland has to offer.

## Professional Information

I've been in the Information Technology field for more than 14 years, starting out with desktop support. Along the way, I've worked as a site support officer for a [global miner][1], similar roles for a [now merged global managed service provider][2], service desk officer for a [government owned corporate][3], server storage and backup administrator, team leader, SME, and specialist in cloud infrastructure services and hosting, cloud solution architect for a [design thinking firm][4] in the UK and Europe, and various roles with [AWS][5] including Technical Account Manager, Enterprise Account Manager and Solutions Architect.

Currently, I work for AWS in the ANZ Public Sector team. In my role, I'm focusing on helping customers achieve great citizen outcomes through innovation and adoption of AWS.

If you'd like more information, my LinkedIn profile is available [here][6], and my GitHub profile is available [here][7].
